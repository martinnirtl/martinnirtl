## Hello there 👋

### My name is Martin Nirtl.

I am an IT engineer 👨‍💻 with strong backgrounds in software, DevOps/platform and electronic engineering.
Currently, I work for [Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/) as a pre-sales solution architect. Besides work, my main side-hustles are all around Kubernetes ⛵, IaC and automating things. From time to time, I even build little apps in Go or other languages.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/martinnirtl) 🐦, where i mostly retweet things that i find useful or funny, or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinnirtl/).

Outside of my IT bubble, I love spending time with my kids and family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦.
